# Little Lemon App - Flutter Experimental Build 🍋

Welcome to my personal laboratory! This project is a Flutter implementation of the Little Lemon app, serving as my primary playground for mobile development experimentation and architectural research.

## 🚀 Project Philosophy
This isn't just a "functional app"—it's a reflection of my journey in mastering the Flutter ecosystem. I use this codebase to test the limits of UI responsiveness and code maintainability.

### 🧪 Current Focus & Experiments:
* **Architecture Exploration:** Currently experimenting with modular structures to ensure the app is scalable.
* **Performance Tuning:** Implementing best practices for smooth rendering and efficient state management.
* **UX Research:** Deep-diving into "Little Lemon" design guidelines to create a high-fidelity mobile experience.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Flutter (Latest Stable)
* **Language:** Dart
* **Design Pattern:** Experimental (Currently refactoring for better Clean Architecture implementation).

## 🚧 Status: Deep Refactoring Phase
**Note:** I am currently in a "Deep Refactoring" cycle.
Updates to the main branch might be less frequent over the next few weeks as I am focusing heavily on **core architecture optimization** and **under-the-hood logic** rather than UI changes.

I believe in building a solid foundation before adding more features. Quality over speed!
